				<description>Carriers of this gene are tall, broad and staggeringly strong. The sheer size of these pawns makes them ruthless fighters at the cost of being much easier to hit and painful to do lovin' with.\n\nThey are visually larger than baseliners. There are some weapons that only Herculean pawns can equip.</description>
